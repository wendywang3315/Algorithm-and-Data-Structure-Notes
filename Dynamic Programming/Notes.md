Dynamic programming problems have two characteristics:
1. **Optimal Substructive**
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**
Here optimal substructive means an optimal solution to the "big problem" would entail an optimal solution to similar-type subproblems. And as you break the large problem into smaller problems, often you would need to re-calculate the same thing. The overlapping subproblems characteristics allow you to store intermediate solutions and reuse them for calculations.
